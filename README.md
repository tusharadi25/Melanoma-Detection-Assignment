## Problem statement:
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- The model exhibits increasing accuracy on the training set but decreasing accuracy on the validation set, indicating overfitting.
- The model's loss decreases on the training set but increases on the validation set, further supporting the overfitting diagnosis.
- Early stopping, regularization, data augmentation, and dropout are potential strategies to mitigate overfitting.
- Hyperparameter tuning, model architecture adjustments, and further experimentation are recommended for optimization.
